# Offline Face Recognition System Guide

## Overview

The student attendance system now includes a robust **offline face recognition** capability that ensures attendance data is never lost, even when there's no internet connection. The face recognition engine runs locally in the browser, and failed attendance submissions are automatically queued for retry when the connection is restored.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Local Face Recognition**
- Face recognition runs entirely in the browser using `face-api.js`
- No internet required for face detection and recognition
- Student face descriptors are stored locally for comparison

### 2. **Offline Detection**
The system automatically detects when:
- Internet connection is lost (`navigator.onLine = false`)
- Database operations timeout
- Firebase operations fail

### 3. **Automatic Queuing**
When attendance marking fails due to connectivity issues:
- Attendance data is saved to `localStorage` with full metadata
- Each record includes:
  - Student information (ID, name, authUid)
  - Timestamp and date
  - Shift and class information
  - Calculated status (present/late based on time)
  - Network error details
  - Face recognition confidence

### 4. **Automatic Sync**
- System listens for `online` events
- Automatically attempts to sync pending records every 30 seconds when online
- Shows real-time sync notifications
- Removes records from queue after successful sync

---

## User Interface Indicators

### Network Status
- **🟢 Online**: Green indicator, normal operation
- **🔴 Offline**: Red indicator, offline mode active
- Toast notifications when connection status changes

### Pending Attendance Widget
Located at bottom-right of screen, displays:
- Number of pending attendance records
- Time since each record was created
- Network status (offline/timeout/error)
- "Old" badge for records older than 24 hours

### Actions Available
- **Sync Now**: Manually trigger sync when online
- **Retry**: Manually retry a specific record
- **Clear Old**: Remove records older than 24 hours
- **Clear All**: Remove all pending records (with confirmation)

## Testing the Offline System

### Test Scenario 1: Complete Internet Loss

1. **Setup**:
   - Open the face scan page
   - Start the camera
   - Verify face recognition is working

2. **Simulate Offline**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to "Network" tab
   - Check "Offline" in the throttling dropdown
   - Or disconnect from WiFi/Ethernet

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Face recognition continues to work
   - When a face is recognized:
     - Toast shows: "📴 Offline: [Student Name]'s attendance saved. Will sync when online."
     - Record appears in pending widget (bottom-right)
     - Widget shows offline status

4. **Restore Connection**:
   - Uncheck "Offline" in DevTools or reconnect to network
   - Toast shows: "🟢 Internet connection restored. Syncing pending attendance..."
   - Records automatically sync within 30 seconds
   - Success toast: "✅ Successfully synced X attendance record(s)"
   - Records disappear from pending widget

### Test Scenario 2: Slow/Unstable Connection

1. **Setup**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Go to "Network" tab
   - Set throttling to "Slow 3G" or "Fast 3G"

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Face recognition works normally
   - Database operations may timeout (3 retries with exponential backoff)
   - If all retries fail: attendance queued with "timeout" status
   - Automatic retry when connection improves

### Test Scenario 3: Firestore Rate Limiting

1. **Setup**:
   - Mark multiple attendances rapidly

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Some requests may fail with Firebase errors
   - Failed requests are queued
   - Automatic retry with backoff prevents overwhelming the system

### Test Scenario 4: Long Offline Period

1. **Simulate Extended Offline**:
   - Go offline for several hours
   - Mark multiple attendances during this period

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - All attendances are queued locally
   - Pending widget shows all records with timestamps
   - Records older than 24 hours marked as "Old"
   - When connection restored:
     - Recent records (< 24h) sync automatically
     - Old records can be cleared or manually synced

---

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

#### 1. `offlineAttendanceManager.ts`
Core manager class that handles:
- Network status monitoring
- localStorage operations
- Automatic retry logic
- Event dispatching

```typescript
// Features:
- Network status detection (navigator.onLine + custom checks)
- Automatic retry every 30 seconds when online
- Event listeners for online/offline transitions
- localStorage record management
- Statistics and reporting
```

#### 2. `attendanceLogic.ts` Enhancement
The `markAttendance` function now:
- Detects network errors (offline, timeout, other)
- Saves failed attempts with full metadata
- Uses proper attendance status calculation
- Dispatches events for UI updates

#### 3. `FailedAttendanceManager.tsx`
React component that provides:
- Real-time pending record display
- Network status visualization
- Manual sync controls
- Record management (retry, clear)

### Storage Format

Records are stored in `localStorage` with keys:
```
failed_attendance_[studentId]_[date]_[shift]_[timestamp]
```

Example record structure:
```json
{
  "studentId": "abc123",
  "studentName": "John Doe",
  "authUid": "firebase-uid",
  "date": "2025-10-01",
  "timeIn": "07:15",
  "status": "present",
  "shift": "Morning",
  "method": "face-api",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T07:15:30.123Z",
  "startTime": "07:00",
  "class": "Class 12A",
  "gracePeriodMinutes": 15,
  "errorReason": "Network request failed",
  "networkStatus": "offline",
  "requiresManualReview": false,
  "failedAttempts": 3,
  "savedAt": "2025-10-01T07:15:35.456Z",
  "synced": false
}
```

### Event System

The system dispatches custom events for UI updates:

```javascript
// When attendance is saved offline
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('offlineAttendanceSaved', {
  detail: { studentName, networkStatus, count }
}));

// When attendance is successfully synced
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('offlineAttendanceSynced', {
  detail: { studentName, count }
}));

// When records are cleared
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('offlineAttendanceCleared', {
  detail: { count: 0 }
}));
```

## Retry Logic

### Exponential Backoff
When marking attendance fails:
1. **Attempt 1**: Immediate
2. **Attempt 2**: Wait 1 second
3. **Attempt 3**: Wait 2 seconds
4. **Max wait**: 5 seconds

### Automatic Retry Conditions
Records are automatically retried when:
- Network status changes to online
- Every 30 seconds (if online)
- Record is less than 24 hours old

### Manual Retry
Users can manually retry:
- Individual records (click retry button)
- All records (click "Sync Now" button)

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Duplicate Prevention**
- Before saving, system checks for existing attendance record
- Prevents duplicate entries when retrying

### 2. **Date Preservation**
- Original attendance date is preserved during retry
- Ensures attendance is marked for correct day, not retry day

### 3. **Status Calculation**
- Late/present status calculated based on original timestamp
- Uses student's class/shift configuration
- Handles special cases (e.g., Class 12NKGS on Saturday)

### 4. **Old Record Management**
- Records older than 24 hours flagged for review
- Can be manually cleared or forced to sync
- Prevents localStorage bloat

### 5. **Concurrent Operations**
- Only one retry operation runs at a time
- Prevents race conditions
- Queues retry requests if already in progress

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Requirements
- Modern browser with:
  - `localStorage` support
  - `navigator.onLine` API
  - `EventTarget` for custom events
  - `MediaStream` API (for camera)

### Tested Browsers
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+

---

## Performance Considerations

### localStorage Limits
- Typical browser limit: 5-10 MB
- Each record: ~1-2 KB
- Can store ~5,000-10,000 records safely
- Old records auto-cleaned after 24 hours

### Memory Usage
- Minimal memory footprint
- Records loaded on-demand
- No in-memory caching of all records

### Network Efficiency
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Automatic retry only when online
- Batch sync (all pending records processed together)

---

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Logs
The system provides detailed console logging:
- `🌐` Network status changes
- `💾` localStorage operations
- `🔄` Retry attempts
- `✅` Successful syncs
- `❌` Failed operations

### Statistics
Access system statistics programmatically:
```javascript
const stats = offlineAttendanceManager.getStats();
// Returns: { total, recentHour, olderThan24h }
```

### Export Records
Export pending records for analysis:
```javascript
const json = offlineAttendanceManager.exportRecords();
console.log(json);
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Records stored in browser's localStorage (client-side only)
- Not transmitted until sync
- Cleared when user clears browser data

### Authentication
- Retry uses same Firebase authentication
- No credentials stored in localStorage
- Only attendance metadata stored

### Validation
- All data validated before storage
- Schema validation on retrieval
- Malformed records skipped gracefully

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Records not syncing
**Solutions**:
1. Check network status indicator
2. Try manual "Sync Now" button
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Firebase connection (try marking new attendance)

### Problem: Duplicate attendance after sync
**Solutions**:
1. System should prevent duplicates automatically
2. Check for race conditions (multiple tabs open?)
3. Clear old records and sync manually

### Problem: localStorage full
**Solutions**:
1. Clear old records (>24h)
2. Clear all records and sync manually
3. Check other applications using localStorage

### Problem: Sync fails repeatedly
**Solutions**:
1. Check Firebase quota/limits
2. Verify authentication token is valid
3. Check for Firebase rule changes
4. Review console errors for specific issues

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **IndexedDB Migration**: For larger storage capacity
2. **Sync History**: Track all sync operations
3. **Batch Optimization**: Optimize batch sync performance
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle complex sync conflicts
5. **Background Sync**: Use Service Workers for background sync
6. **Progressive Web App**: Full offline PWA support

### Configuration Options (Future)
- Configurable retry intervals
- Custom retry strategies
- Adjustable storage limits
- Sync priority rules
