# Notification Delivery Logs Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the notification system to track and display Telegram notification delivery status for permission and leave early requests. This provides visibility into which parents received notifications and helps troubleshoot delivery issues.

## What Changed

### 1. TypeScript Interfaces (`app/_interfaces/index.ts`)
Added a new `NotificationLog` interface to track notification delivery:

```typescript
export interface NotificationLog {
  chatId: string;              // Telegram chat ID of the parent
  parentName?: string;          // Name of the parent (if available)
  sentAt: Timestamp;            // When the notification was sent
  success: boolean;             // Whether delivery was successful
  errorMessage?: string;        // Error message if delivery failed
  errorCode?: number;           // Telegram API error code
  deactivated?: boolean;        // Whether parent notification was deactivated
}
```

Updated existing interfaces:
- **PermissionRecord**: Added `notificationLogs`, `authUid` fields
- **LeaveEarlyRequest**: Added `notificationLogs`, `authUid`, `date`, `shift` fields

### 2. Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)

#### Updated Functions:
- **notifyParentOnPermissionRequest** (Line ~5840)
- **notifyParentOnLeaveEarlyRequest** (Line ~5940)

#### Changes:
1. **Capture notification attempts**: Each parent notification attempt is logged with:
   - Chat ID and parent name
   - Timestamp
   - Success/failure status
   - Error details if failed
   - Whether the parent notification was deactivated (bot blocked)

2. **Save logs to Firestore**: After sending notifications, the function updates the request document with:
   ```javascript
   await event.data.ref.update({
     notificationLogs: notificationLogs,
     notificationsSent: notificationsSent,
     lastNotificationAt: admin.firestore.Timestamp.now()
   });
   ```

3. **Better error tracking**: Captures Telegram API error codes and messages for troubleshooting

### 3. UI Component (`app/dashboard/students/components/PendingRequestsSection.tsx`)

#### New Features:

**NotificationStatus Component**:
- Displays summary of notification delivery (e.g., "‚úì Sent to 2 parents")
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - üü¢ Green: All notifications delivered successfully
  - üî¥ Red: All notifications failed
  - üü† Orange: Mixed success/failure
  
**Expandable Details**:
- Click "View details" to see per-parent delivery status
- Shows:
  - Parent name (if available)
  - Delivery timestamp
  - Success/failure indicator
  - Error message (if failed)
  - Deactivation notice (if bot was blocked)

**Updated Layout**:
- Changed from 2-column to single-column layout for better readability
- Added notification status section below each request
- Improved visual hierarchy

## How It Works

### Flow:
1. **Student submits request** ‚Üí Permission or Leave Early request created in Firestore
2. **Cloud Function triggered** ‚Üí `notifyParentOnPermissionRequest` or `notifyParentOnLeaveEarlyRequest`
3. **Notifications sent** ‚Üí Function attempts to send Telegram message to all registered parents
4. **Logs saved** ‚Üí Delivery status for each parent is saved to the request document
5. **UI displays status** ‚Üí Admin sees real-time notification delivery status in PendingRequestsSection

### Example Notification Log:
```javascript
{
  chatId: "123456789",
  parentName: "Mrs. Smith",
  sentAt: Timestamp,
  success: true,
  errorMessage: null,
  errorCode: null,
  deactivated: false
}
```

### Example Failed Notification:
```javascript
{
  chatId: "987654321",
  parentName: "Mr. Johnson",
  sentAt: Timestamp,
  success: false,
  errorMessage: "Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user",
  errorCode: 403,
  deactivated: true
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Visibility**: Admins can see which parents received notifications
2. **Troubleshooting**: Error messages help identify and fix delivery issues
3. **Accountability**: Timestamp tracking shows exactly when notifications were sent
4. **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically deactivates notifications for blocked bots
5. **User confidence**: Clear indicators that parents were notified

## UI Examples

### All Notifications Successful:
```
‚úì Sent to 2 parents
  View details ‚ñº
    ‚úì Delivered to Mrs. Smith
      Oct 23, 3:45 PM
    ‚úì Delivered to Mr. Johnson
      Oct 23, 3:45 PM
```

### Mixed Success:
```
‚ö† 1 sent, 1 failed
  View details ‚ñº
    ‚úì Delivered to Mrs. Smith
      Oct 23, 3:45 PM
    ‚úó Failed to Mr. Johnson
      Oct 23, 3:45 PM
      Error: Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user
      ‚ö† Parent notification deactivated (bot blocked)
```

### No Notifications Yet:
```
üïê No notifications sent yet
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema:
Requests now include these additional fields:
- `notificationLogs` (array): Array of NotificationLog objects
- `notificationsSent` (number): Count of successful deliveries
- `lastNotificationAt` (timestamp): When last notification was sent

### Icon Usage:
- `mdiCheckCircle`: Success indicator
- `mdiCloseCircle`: Failure indicator
- `mdiClockOutline`: Pending/no notifications
- `mdiBellRing`: Mixed success/failure
- `mdiEye`: View details button

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test successful delivery**: Submit request with active parent notification
2. **Test failed delivery**: Submit request with blocked/inactive parent
3. **Test multiple parents**: Ensure logs capture all delivery attempts
4. **Test error handling**: Verify error messages are captured correctly
5. **Test UI responsiveness**: Check expandable details work smoothly

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add retry mechanism for failed notifications
2. Display notification history in student detail modal
3. Add notification preferences per parent
4. Implement notification templates for different languages
5. Add notification analytics dashboard

## Maintenance Notes

- Notification logs are stored directly in request documents (no separate collection)
- Logs are immutable once created (no updates, only appends on retry)
- Failed notifications automatically deactivate parent notifications to prevent spam
- Error codes follow Telegram Bot API error code standards
