## Data Flow

### Student Request Flow:
1. Student navigates to Activities page
2. If active rewards exist, they see the Star Rewards section
3. Student clicks to expand the section
4. Selects a reward and provides a reason (min 10 words)
5. System validates claim limits automatically
6. Request is created in `starRequests` collection with status 'pending'

### Admin Approval Flow (Two Options):

#### Option A: From Student Detail Page
1. Admin navigates to student detail page ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Views all star requests for that student
3. Clicks Approve or Reject directly
4. If rejected, provides a reason via prompt
5. Status updates immediately

#### Option B: From Star Request Detail Page
1. Admin navigates to `/dashboard/stars/[requestId]`
2. Views comprehensive request details
3. Clicks Approve or Reject
4. If rejected, provides reason via modal
5. When approved, stars are automatically added to student's claimedStars sub-collection
