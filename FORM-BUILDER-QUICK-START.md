### Test the Feature
1. **As Admin**: Create a test form with different question types
2. **As Student**: Log in and view/submit the form
3. **As Admin**: View responses and export CSV

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Required Questions**: Mark important questions as required (*)
2. **Deadlines**: Set realistic deadlines - forms auto-hide after expiration
3. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive titles so students know what it's about
4. **Test First**: Create a test form and submit it yourself before sharing
5. **Export Often**: Download CSV backups of responses regularly

## 🎓 Example Use Cases

- **Feedback Surveys** - Get student feedback on classes
- **Event Registration** - Register for school events
- **Preference Forms** - Collect student preferences
- **Satisfaction Surveys** - Measure satisfaction
- **Quick Polls** - Quick questions with linear scales
- **Permission Forms** - Digital permission slips

## 📈 Analytics Example

When you view responses, you'll see:

**For Multiple Choice:**
```
Option A ████████████ 45% (9 responses)
Option B ████████ 30% (6 responses)
Option C █████ 25% (5 responses)
```

**For Linear Scale:**
```
Average Rating: 8.5 / 10
(based on 15 responses)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Forms not showing for students?**
- Make sure form is marked as "Active"
- Check deadline is in the future

**Can't save form?**
- Ensure all questions have text
- Choice questions need at least 2 options
- Form needs a title and deadline

**CSV export empty?**
- Make sure there are responses first
- Check browser allows downloads
