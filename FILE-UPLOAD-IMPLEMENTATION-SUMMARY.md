### Storage Structure
```
Firebase Storage Path:
form_responses/{formId}/{questionId}/{timestamp}_{sanitized_filename}
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
FormAnswer {
  questionId: string;
  answer: string; // File names joined with ', '
  fileUrls?: string[]; // Firebase Storage download URLs
  fileNames?: string[]; // Original file names
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. Max 10 files per question
2. Max 100 MB per file
3. Type validation based on MIME types
4. Required field enforcement

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Security Considerations
1. ✅ File name sanitization (removes special characters)
2. ✅ MIME type validation
3. ✅ File size limits enforced
4. ✅ Authentication required for upload
5. ✅ Secure Firebase Storage URLs
6. ⚠️ **Note**: Firebase Storage rules should be configured appropriately
