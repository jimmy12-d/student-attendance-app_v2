# Multilingual Support Implementation for Student PWA

## Overview
Successfully implemented multilingual support for the Next.js PWA using `next-intl` library with support for English ('en') and Khmer ('kh') languages.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration
- **File**: `next.config.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `next-intl` plugin with custom i18n configuration path
  - Configured internationalized routing for both locales
  - Added redirects for localized routes

### 2. Internationalization Setup
- **File**: `i18n.ts`
- **Purpose**: Central configuration for locale detection and message loading
- **Locales**: English ('en') and Khmer ('kh')
- **Messages**: Dynamically loaded from JSON files

### 3. Middleware Configuration
- **File**: `middleware.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated `next-intl` middleware for automatic locale detection
  - Set `localePrefix: 'always'` to ensure all routes are prefixed with locale
  - Maintained PWA functionality with proper headers
  - Applied i18n only to student-related routes (admin/teacher excluded)

### 4. Language Files
- **Location**: `/locales/`
- **Files**: 
  - `en.json` - English translations
  - `kh.json` - Khmer translations
- **Structure**: Organized by feature areas (common, language, onboarding, navigation, student, auth, notifications)

### 5. Language Onboarding Screen
- **File**: `app/_components/LanguageOnboarding.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful UI with language selection cards
  - Persistent language preference storage
  - Automatic redirection to selected locale
  - Support for both English and Khmer

### 6. Language Selector Component
- **File**: `app/student/_components/LanguageSelector.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown interface for language switching
  - Real-time route updates when language changes
  - Visual indicators for current language
  - Accessible design with proper keyboard navigation

### 7. Localized Route Structure
- **Structure**: `app/[locale]/`
- **Routes Created**:
  - `/[locale]/login` - Localized login page
  - `/[locale]/student/` - Main student routes
  - `/[locale]/student/home` - Student home (redirects to attendance)
  - `/[locale]/student/attendance` - Attendance page
  - `/[locale]/student/account` - Account settings with language selector
  - `/[locale]/student/mock-exam` - Mock exam results

### 8. Component Updates
- **StudentTopNav**: Added language selector for localized routes
- **StudentBottomNav**: Updated to handle localized navigation
- **StudentLayout**: Integrated translations and locale-aware redirects

### 9. Main App Logic
- **File**: `app/page.tsx`
- **Functionality**:
  - Checks for existing language preference
  - Shows onboarding screen for new users
  - Redirects to appropriate localized route based on auth status

## URL Structure Examples
- English: `http://localhost:3000/en/student/attendance`
- Khmer: `http://localhost:3000/kh/student/attendance`
- Root: `http://localhost:3000/` (shows language onboarding)

## Usage Flow
1. User visits the app for the first time
2. Language onboarding screen appears
3. User selects preferred language (English or Khmer)
4. App redirects to appropriate localized route
5. Language preference is stored in localStorage
6. User can change language anytime via the language selector in the top navigation

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Locale Prefix Strategy**: Used `localePrefix: 'always'` to ensure clear URL structure
2. **PWA Compatibility**: Maintained all PWA functionality while adding i18n
3. **Selective Implementation**: Applied i18n only to student routes, keeping admin/teacher unchanged
4. **Persistent Preferences**: Used localStorage for language preference storage
5. **Fallback Handling**: Proper error handling and fallbacks for missing translations

## Future Enhancements
- Add more languages as needed
- Implement RTL support for Arabic/Hebrew if required
- Add translation management system for easier content updates
- Consider server-side locale detection based on user location

## Testing
- Build completed successfully
- Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- All routes accessible and functional
- Language switching works seamlessly
- PWA functionality preserved
