# Expected Revenue Price Calculation Fix

## Overview
Fixed the expected revenue calculation to correctly fetch class prices by following the proper data relationship chain: `student.class` → `classes.type` → `classTypes.price`

## Date Fixed
October 4, 2025

## Problem
The previous implementation was incorrectly trying to access `studentData.classType` directly, which doesn't exist in the student data structure. This resulted in the price lookup always falling back to the default $25 value, making the expected revenue calculations inaccurate.

### Previous (Incorrect) Logic:
```typescript
// ❌ Incorrect - studentData.classType doesn't exist
const studentPrice = classTypePrices.get(studentData.classType) || 25;
```

## Solution
Updated the code to follow the correct data relationship chain:

1. **Get student's class ID**: `studentData.class` (e.g., "Class A")
2. **Look up class type**: Find the `type` field from the `classes` collection (e.g., "MWF")
3. **Get price**: Use the type to fetch the `price` from the `classTypes` collection

### New (Correct) Logic:
```typescript
// ✅ Correct - follows the proper data chain
const studentClass = studentData.class;              // e.g., "Class A"
const classType = classToTypeMap.get(studentClass);  // e.g., "MWF"
const studentPrice = classTypePrices.get(classType) || 25; // Get actual price
```

## Data Structure

### Students Collection
```typescript
{
  fullName: "John Doe",
  class: "Class A",     // ← Links to classes collection
  ay: "2026",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastPaymentMonth: "October 2025",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Classes Collection
```typescript
// Document ID: "Class A"
{
  type: "MWF",         // ← Links to classTypes collection
  // ... other fields
}
```

### ClassTypes Collection
```typescript
// Document ID: "MWF"
{
  price: 30,          // ← The actual price we need
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `app/dashboard/payment-summary/page.tsx`

#### 1. Added Classes Collection Fetch
```typescript
// Fetch classes to get type mapping
const classesRef = collection(db, "classes");
const classesSnapshot = await getDocs(classesRef);
const classToTypeMap = new Map<string, string>();
classesSnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
  const data = doc.data();
  classToTypeMap.set(doc.id, data.type || ''); // Map class ID to type
});
```

#### 2. Updated Price Lookup Logic
```typescript
const studentClass = studentData.class; // e.g., "Class A"
const classType = classToTypeMap.get(studentClass) || ''; // e.g., "MWF"
const studentPrice = classTypePrices.get(classType) || 25; // Get price
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Pricing**: Expected revenue now uses actual class prices instead of defaulting to $25
2. **Different Class Types**: Properly handles different pricing for MWF, TTH, SAT, etc.
3. **Data Integrity**: Respects the existing database structure and relationships
4. **Maintainable**: Price changes in `classTypes` automatically reflect in calculations

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Different Class Types
**Before Fix:**
- 3 MWF students ($30 each) → Calculated as $75 (3 × $25 default)
- 2 SAT students ($40 each) → Calculated as $50 (2 × $25 default)
- **Total**: $125 (incorrect)

**After Fix:**
- 3 MWF students ($30 each) → Calculated as $90 (3 × $30 actual)
- 2 SAT students ($40 each) → Calculated as $80 (2 × $40 actual)
- **Total**: $170 (correct)

### Scenario 2: Trial Period vs Existing
**Student Data:**
- Trial Period Student in "Class A" (type: MWF, price: $30)
- Existing Unpaid in "Class B" (type: SAT, price: $40)

**Expected Revenue Display:**
```
Expected Revenue
$70.00

● Trial Period (1)     $30.00  ← Correct MWF price
● Existing Unpaid (1)  $40.00  ← Correct SAT price
```

## Fallback Behavior
The code still includes a fallback to $25 in two cases:
1. If a student's class is not found in the `classes` collection
2. If a class type is not found in the `classTypes` collection

This ensures the calculation never fails, but logs can be added to identify data inconsistencies.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify MWF class students show $30 (or correct MWF price)
- [ ] Verify SAT class students show $40 (or correct SAT price)
- [ ] Verify TTH class students show their correct price
- [ ] Check trial period breakdown uses correct prices
- [ ] Check existing unpaid breakdown uses correct prices
- [ ] Verify total expected revenue matches sum of breakdowns
- [ ] Test with students in classes not in `classes` collection (should default to $25)
- [ ] Test with class types not in `classTypes` collection (should default to $25)

## Performance Notes

- Added one additional Firestore query to fetch the `classes` collection
- This query is executed once per page load, cached in `classToTypeMap`
- Minimal performance impact as the classes collection is typically small (<100 documents)
- All lookups use Map.get() which is O(1) time complexity

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add validation to ensure all students have valid class assignments
- Log warnings when fallback to $25 occurs
- Add admin UI to verify class → classType relationships
- Cache class and classType data in localStorage for faster loads
- Add data consistency checks in admin panel
