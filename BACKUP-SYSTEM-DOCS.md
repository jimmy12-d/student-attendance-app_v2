# Firebase Database Backup System

This documentation covers the complete Firebase backup system implemented for your student attendance application.

## Overview

The backup system provides:
- **Automatic cloud backups** that run daily at midnight UTC using Firebase Functions (NO LAPTOP REQUIRED!)
- **Manual cloud backups** via admin interface triggered on-demand
- **Local backup scripts** for development and testing (legacy)
- **Full database restoration** with selective collection support (local only)
- **Backup management** through web interface
- **Data integrity verification**
- **Automatic cleanup** of old backups (keeps 30 days in cloud)

## ðŸŒŸ NEW: Cloud-Based Automatic Backups

### What's New
Your backup system now runs completely in the cloud using Firebase Functions! This means:
- âœ… Backups run automatically even when your laptop is closed
- âœ… No need to keep any local processes running
- âœ… Reliable, cloud-based scheduling
- âœ… Backups stored in Google Cloud Storage for durability
- âœ… Automatic cleanup of old backups
- âœ… Real-time backup status tracking

### Access Cloud Backup Management
Visit `/dashboard/cloud-backup` directly in your application to:
- View backup history and status
- Create manual backups instantly
- Monitor backup health and statistics
- Track storage usage and backup success rates

**Note**: This page is only accessible to admin users. You can navigate directly to the URL.

### How It Works
1. **Scheduled Function**: Runs daily at midnight UTC automatically
2. **Cloud Storage**: All backups stored securely in Google Cloud Storage
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking via Firestore `backupHistory` collection
4. **Cleanup**: Automatically removes backups older than 30 days
5. **Admin Access**: Only admin users can trigger manual backups

## Quick Start

### 1. Cloud Backups (Recommended)

The easiest way to use backups is through the cloud system:

```bash
# No installation needed! Just visit your admin interface:
# https://your-app.com/admin/cloud-backup
```

**Features:**
- Automatic daily backups at midnight UTC
- Manual backup creation with one click
- Real-time backup status monitoring
- 30-day retention with automatic cleanup
- No laptop or local setup required

### 2. Local Development Backups (Optional)

For development and testing, you can still use local scripts:

```bash
npm install node-cron
```

Set environment variables in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...your-private-key...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### 3. Create Your First Cloud Backup

Visit `/admin/cloud-backup` and click "Create Manual Backup" or wait for the automatic midnight backup!

## Usage

### Cloud Backup Management (Primary Method)

Access your backup system at `/admin/cloud-backup`:

- **View Backup History**: See all backups with status, size, and timing
- **Create Manual Backup**: One-click backup creation
- **Monitor Status**: Real-time backup success/failure tracking
- **Automatic Schedule**: Daily backups at midnight UTC (no action needed)

### Firebase Functions Deployed

Your system now includes these cloud functions:

```javascript
// Automatic scheduled backup (runs daily at midnight UTC)
exports.scheduledBackup = onSchedule("0 0 * * *", async (event) => {
  // Backs up all Firestore collections to Cloud Storage
});

// Manual backup (callable by admin users)
exports.manualBackup = onCall(async (request) => {
  // Creates immediate backup when triggered
});
```

### Local Command Line Usage (Development Only)

For development and testing, you can still use local scripts:

### Creating Backups

```bash
# Basic backup (all collections)
node scripts/firebase-backup.js

# Backup specific collections only
node scripts/firebase-backup.js --collections=students,transactions

# Create compressed backup
node scripts/firebase-backup.js --compress

# Backup with all options
node scripts/firebase-backup.js --collections=students,transactions --compress
```

### Restoring Backups

```bash
# Dry run (simulation) - ALWAYS test first!
node scripts/firebase-restore.js --backup-id=backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00 --dry-run

# Restore specific collections
node scripts/firebase-restore.js --backup-id=backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00 --collections=students

# Full restore (BE CAREFUL!)
node scripts/firebase-restore.js --backup-id=backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00
```

### Scheduled Backups

```bash
# Start backup scheduler (runs in foreground)
node scripts/scheduled-backup.js

# Start as daemon (background process)
node scripts/scheduled-backup.js --start-daemon

# Custom schedule (daily at 3 AM)
node scripts/scheduled-backup.js --cron-schedule="0 3 * * *"

# Run a single backup immediately
node scripts/scheduled-backup.js --run-once
```

## NPM Scripts

Add these to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "backup:create": "node scripts/firebase-backup.js --compress",
    "backup:restore": "node scripts/firebase-restore.js",
    "backup:schedule": "node scripts/scheduled-backup.js --start-daemon",
    "backup:once": "node scripts/scheduled-backup.js --run-once"
  }
}
```

## Web Interface

Access the backup management interface at `/admin/backup` in your application.

Features:
- **View all backups** with details (size, collections, document count)
- **Create new backups** manually
- **Restore backups** with dry-run option
- **Delete old backups**
- **Health status** of each backup

## Cloud Backup Structure

Each cloud backup creates files in Google Cloud Storage:

```
gs://your-project.appspot.com/firestore-backups/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backup-manifest.json      # Backup metadata
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ students.json            # Students collection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transactions.json        # Transactions collection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ classes.json            # Classes collection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ classTypes.json         # Class types collection
â””â”€â”€ backup-2024-01-16T02-00-00/
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Backup Tracking

All backup operations are tracked in Firestore:

```javascript
// Collection: backupHistory
{
  backupId: "backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  status: "completed", // or "failed"
  totalCollections: 4,
  totalDocuments: 1250,
  totalSize: 2048576,
  duration: 15230, // milliseconds
  backupType: "scheduled_cloud_function", // or "manual"
  storagePath: "firestore-backups/backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00/"
}
```

## Local Backup Structure (Legacy)

Local backups still work for development:

```
backups/firestore/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backup-manifest.json      # Backup metadata
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ students.json            # Students collection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transactions.json        # Transactions collection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ classes.json            # Classes collection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ classTypes.json         # Class types collection
â””â”€â”€ backup-2024-01-16T02-00-00/
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Manifest File Structure

```json
{
  "backupId": "backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "projectId": "your-project-id",
  "totalCollections": 4,
  "totalDocuments": 1250,
  "totalSize": 2048576,
  "collections": [
    {
      "collection": "students",
      "documentCount": 450,
      "filePath": "students.json",
      "size": 1024000
    }
  ],
  "compressed": true,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Data Types Handling

The backup system properly handles Firestore-specific data types:

- **Timestamps** â†’ Converted to ISO strings with type markers
- **Document References** â†’ Stored as paths with type markers  
- **Arrays and Objects** â†’ Recursively processed
- **Nested Documents** â†’ Fully preserved

Example serialized data:
```json
{
  "createdAt": {
    "_type": "timestamp",
    "_value": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "classRef": {
    "_type": "reference", 
    "_value": "classes/math-101"
  }
}
```

## Automation & Scheduling

### Cron Schedule Examples

```bash
# Daily at 2 AM
"0 2 * * *"

# Every 6 hours
"0 */6 * * *"

# Weekly on Sundays at 3 AM
"0 3 * * 0"

# Monthly on 1st at midnight
"0 0 1 * *"
```

### Production Deployment

For production environments, consider using:

1. **PM2** for process management:
```bash
pm2 start scripts/scheduled-backup.js --name="backup-scheduler" -- --start-daemon
```

2. **Systemd service** (Linux):
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Firebase Backup Scheduler
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/app
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node scripts/scheduled-backup.js --start-daemon
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. **Docker container** with volume mounts for backup storage

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Log Files

Scheduled backups create logs at:
```
logs/backup-scheduler.log
```

Log format:
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [INFO] Starting scheduled backup...
[2024-01-15T10:30:15.000Z] [SUCCESS] Backup completed successfully: backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00
[2024-01-15T10:30:15.000Z] [INFO]   - Duration: 15.23 seconds
[2024-01-15T10:30:15.000Z] [INFO]   - Collections: 4
[2024-01-15T10:30:15.000Z] [INFO]   - Documents: 1250
[2024-01-15T10:30:15.000Z] [INFO]   - Size: 2.00 MB
```

### API Endpoints for Monitoring

```javascript
// Check backup status
GET /api/admin/backup?action=list

// Get specific backup details  
GET /api/admin/backup?action=manifest&backupId=backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Service Account Permissions**: Ensure your Firebase service account has only necessary permissions
2. **Backup Storage**: Store backups in secure, access-controlled locations
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit private keys to version control
4. **Access Control**: Restrict backup management to admin users only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Firebase credentials not found"
```bash
# Solution: Check environment variables
echo $FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
echo $FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
```

**Issue**: "Permission denied" on Firestore
```bash
# Solution: Verify service account has Firestore permissions:
# - Cloud Datastore User
# - Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent
```

**Issue**: "Backup directory not writable"
```bash
# Solution: Check permissions
chmod 755 backups/
```

**Issue**: "Large backups failing"
```bash
# Solution: Increase Node.js memory limit
node --max-old-space-size=4096 scripts/firebase-backup.js
```

### Backup Validation

Test your backups regularly:

```bash
# 1. Create a test backup
npm run backup:create

# 2. Run restore simulation  
node scripts/firebase-restore.js --backup-id=YOUR_BACKUP_ID --dry-run

# 3. Check backup integrity
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const manifest = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./backups/firestore/YOUR_BACKUP_ID/backup-manifest.json'));
console.log('Backup Health:', manifest.totalDocuments > 0 ? 'GOOD' : 'BAD');
"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Restores Regularly**: Schedule monthly restore tests on a separate environment
2. **Monitor Backup Sizes**: Set up alerts for unusually large or small backups
3. **Retention Policy**: Keep 30 daily backups, 12 monthly backups, 5 yearly backups
4. **Offsite Storage**: Consider uploading backups to cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage)
5. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive backups before storage
6. **Documentation**: Keep restore procedures documented and tested

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs in `logs/backup-scheduler.log`
2. Verify Firebase credentials and permissions
3. Test with a small collection first
4. Use dry-run mode before actual restores
