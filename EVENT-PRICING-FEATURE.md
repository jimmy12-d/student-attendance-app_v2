# Event Pricing Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive pricing functionality to the events system, allowing:
1. **Multiple pricing options** per event (simple numbered tiers like Option 1, Option 2, etc.)
2. **Flexible payment methods**:
   - Stars only
   - Money only
   - Combination (stars + money)
3. **Payment status tracking** - Changes "approve" to "pay" for paid events
4. **Borrow feature** - Students can borrow stars/money if insufficient

## Data Structure

### Event Interface Updates
```typescript
interface PricingOption {
  id: string;
  starPrice?: number; // Stars only option
  moneyPrice?: number; // Money only option (in dollars)
  starWithMoney?: {
    stars: number;
    money: number;
  }; // Combination option
  stock?: number; // Optional ticket limit
  soldCount?: number;
}

interface Event {
  // ... existing fields
  isFree?: boolean; // true if event is free
  pricingOptions?: PricingOption[]; // Multiple pricing tiers
  allowBorrow?: boolean; // Allow students to borrow for payment
}
```

### Form Response Interface Updates
```typescript
interface FormResponse {
  // ... existing fields
  paymentStatus?: 'unpaid' | 'paid' | 'borrowed';
  pricingOptionId?: string; // Which pricing tier selected
  amountPaid?: {
    stars?: number;
    money?: number;
  };
  borrowAmount?: {
    stars?: number;
    money?: number;
  };
  paidAt?: Timestamp | Date;
}
```

## Features Implemented

### 3. Registration/Payment Flow

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Color Coding
- **Free**: Green theme
- **Stars**: Yellow/Gold theme
- **Money**: Green theme
- **Combo**: Purple theme
- **Borrowing**: Blue theme

### Icons Used
- `mdiGift`: Free events
- `mdiStar`: Star payments
- `mdiCurrencyUsd`: Money payments

## Implementation Notes

### State Management
```typescript
// Pricing states in event form
const [isFree, setIsFree] = useState(true);
const [pricingOptions, setPricingOptions] = useState<PricingOption[]>([]);
const [allowBorrow, setAllowBorrow] = useState(false);
```

### Helper Functions
```typescript
// Add new pricing option
addPricingOption()

// Update specific option
updatePricingOption(id, updates)

// Remove option
removePricingOption(id)

// Set payment type (stars/money/combo)
setPricingType(id, type)
```

### Form Validation
- Event name, date, and form selection are required
- For paid events, at least one pricing option should be added
- Each pricing option must have a valid price (either starPrice, moneyPrice, or starWithMoney)

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Student Registration Form
Create a payment selection UI where students can:
- View all available pricing options
- Select their preferred payment method
- See their current balance (stars/money)
- Choose to borrow if needed and allowBorrow is enabled
- Complete payment/registration

### 2. Payment Processing
Implement functions to:
- Deduct stars/money from student accounts
- Record borrow transactions
- Update student financial records
- Generate payment receipts
- Handle refunds if event is cancelled

### 3. Admin Payment Management
Add admin capabilities to:
- View payment status of all registrations
- Manually mark payments as paid/unpaid
- Process refunds
- Track borrowed amounts
- Generate financial reports

### 4. Borrowed Amount Tracking
Create system to:
- Track what students borrowed
- Set repayment schedules
- Send reminders for repayment
- Update student credit scores/limits

### 5. Stock Management
Implement logic to:
- Track sold tickets per pricing option
- Disable options when sold out
- Show "Sold Out" badges
- Handle waitlists

## Database Collections Needed

### Payment Transactions
```typescript
// Collection: "eventPayments"
{
  id: string;
  eventId: string;
  studentId: string;
  pricingOptionId: string;
  amountPaid: {
    stars?: number;
    money?: number;
  };
  borrowAmount?: {
    stars?: number;
    money?: number;
  };
  paymentMethod: 'stars' | 'money' | 'combo';
  status: 'completed' | 'pending' | 'refunded';
  paidAt: Timestamp;
  refundedAt?: Timestamp;
}
```

### Borrow Records
```typescript
// Collection: "eventBorrows"
{
  id: string;
  eventId: string;
  studentId: string;
  borrowAmount: {
    stars?: number;
    money?: number;
  };
  repaidAmount?: {
    stars?: number;
    money?: number;
  };
  borrowedAt: Timestamp;
  dueDate?: Timestamp;
  status: 'active' | 'repaid' | 'overdue';
  repaidAt?: Timestamp;
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create free event
- [ ] Create event with stars-only pricing
- [ ] Create event with money-only pricing
- [ ] Create event with combo pricing
- [ ] Create event with multiple pricing tiers
- [ ] Enable/disable borrowing

## Security Considerations

1. **Payment Validation**: Server-side validation of all payments
2. **Balance Verification**: Check student balances before allowing payment
3. **Double-Spending Prevention**: Use transactions for payment processing
4. **Borrow Limits**: Set maximum borrow amounts per student
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all payment and borrow transactions
6. **Refund Protection**: Implement refund policies and checks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Early Bird Pricing**: Time-based automatic price adjustments
2. **Discount Codes**: Promo codes for special pricing
3. **Group Discounts**: Reduced rates for group registrations
4. **Payment Plans**: Allow installment payments
5. **Scholarship/Free Tickets**: Admin-granted free access
6. **Dynamic Pricing**: Price changes based on demand
7. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Accept real credit card payments
8. **QR Code Tickets**: Generate scannable tickets after payment
