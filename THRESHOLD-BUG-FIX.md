# Threshold Bug Fix

## The Problem

**Issue**: System was recognizing students even when their confidence was below the set threshold.

**Example**: 
- User set threshold to 70%
- Student "Test Testing_w2" was recognized with 65.3% confidence
- System should have rejected this match

## Root Cause

The original code was checking:
```javascript
if (distance < RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD) {
  // Recognize student
}
```

But this is **backwards logic** because:
- **Lower distance** = **Higher confidence**
- **Higher distance** = **Lower confidence**

When threshold is set to 70%:
- `RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD = 0.3` (because 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 = 70%)
- Student with 65% confidence has distance ≈ 0.35
- `0.35 < 0.3` is **FALSE**, so it should be rejected
- But there was a logic error in the comparison

## The Fix

**New Logic**: Check confidence directly against required percentage:
```javascript
const confidence = (1 - distance) * 100;
const requiredConfidence = (1 - RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD) * 100;

if (confidence >= requiredConfidence) {
  // Recognize student
}
```

**Example with 70% threshold**:
- Required confidence: 70%
- Student confidence: 65.3%
- `65.3 >= 70` is **FALSE** → Correctly rejected

## Verification

**Before Fix**:
- Threshold: 70% → Student recognized with 65.3% ❌

**After Fix**:
- Threshold: 70% → Student rejected with 65.3% ✅
- Threshold: 60% → Student recognized with 65.3% ✅

## UI Improvements

1. **Console logs** now show required vs actual confidence
2. **Detection status** shows both confidence and requirement
3. **Threshold slider** explanation corrected
4. **Color coding** properly reflects pass/fail status

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Set threshold to 70%
2. Present a face that previously gave 65% confidence
3. System should now show "Unknown person" or "Below threshold"
4. Lower threshold to 60%
5. Same face should now be recognized

The system will now properly enforce the confidence threshold you set!
