# Forms UX Improvements Summary

## Overview
Three user experience improvements have been added to the form builder feature to enhance usability and provide better feedback.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Checkbox Questions Can Now Have Single Option
**Previous Behavior:** All choice-type questions (multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdown) required at least 2 options.

**New Behavior:** Checkbox questions can now have just 1 option, while multiple choice and dropdown still require at least 2 options.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/forms/_components/QuestionEditor.tsx`
  - Added `minOptionsRequired` constant that checks if question type is 'checkboxes' (allows 1) or other types (requires 2)
  
- `app/dashboard/forms/[formId]/page.tsx`
  - Updated `validateForm()` to use type-specific minimum option requirements
  - Checkboxes: minimum 1 option
  - Multiple choice & Dropdown: minimum 2 options

**Use Case:** This allows scenarios where you want to create a single-option checkbox, such as:
- "I agree to the terms and conditions" ‚òëÔ∏è
- "I want to receive email updates" ‚òëÔ∏è

### 2. ‚úÖ Bulk "Set All Required" Feature
**Feature:** Added two buttons to quickly mark all questions as required or optional with one click.

**UI Location:** In the form builder page, the buttons appear in the questions section header (only when at least one question exists):
- **"Set All Required"** button (green) - marks all questions as required
- **"Clear All Required"** button (gray) - marks all questions as optional

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/forms/[formId]/page.tsx`
  - Added `setAllRequired(required: boolean)` function
  - Added conditional button group in questions section
  - Shows success toast notification on action

**Benefits:**
- Saves time when creating forms with many questions
- No need to manually toggle "Required" on each question
- Clear visual feedback with toast notifications

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Visual Error Indicators on Questions
**Feature:** When validation fails, questions with errors now display clear visual indicators showing exactly what's wrong.

**Visual Elements:**
1. **Red border** around the entire question card
2. **Red background tint** on the question card (light red in light mode, dark red in dark mode)
3. **Error banner** at the top of the question with:
   - Alert icon (‚ö†Ô∏è)
   - "Question has errors:" heading
   - Bulleted list of specific errors
4. **Red border on question text input** when text is empty

**Error Types Detected:**
- Question text is required
- At least X option(s) required (depends on question type)
- X option(s) are empty

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/forms/_components/QuestionEditor.tsx`
  - Added `validationErrors` prop (string array)
  - Added `hasErrors` computed value
  - Added conditional styling for error state
  - Added error banner component with icon and error list
  - Added `mdiAlertCircle` icon import
  
- `app/dashboard/forms/[formId]/page.tsx`
  - Added `questionErrors` state (Record<number, string[]>)
  - Updated `validateForm()` to track errors per question
  - Pass `validationErrors={questionErrors[index]}` to QuestionEditor
  - Clear errors when user edits a question with `updateQuestion()`

**User Experience Flow:**
1. User clicks "Save Form"
2. Validation runs and finds errors
3. Error toast shows: "Please fix X question(s) with errors"
4. Questions with errors are highlighted with red borders and error banners
5. User can see exactly what needs to be fixed for each question
6. When user starts editing a question, the error indicator disappears
7. User clicks "Save Form" again - if fixed, form saves successfully ‚úÖ

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
All implementations maintain full TypeScript type safety:
```typescript
interface QuestionEditorProps {
  question: Question;
  index: number;
  onUpdate: (question: Question) => void;
  onDelete: () => void;
  onDuplicate: () => void;
  validationErrors?: string[]; // New optional prop
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Track validation errors per question index
const [questionErrors, setQuestionErrors] = useState<Record<number, string[]>>({});

// Example: { 0: ["Question text is required"], 2: ["At least 2 options required", "1 option(s) are empty"] }
```

### Validation Logic
```typescript
// Checkboxes: min 1 option
// Multiple choice & Dropdown: min 2 options
const minOptions = q.type === 'checkboxes' ? 1 : 2;
```
