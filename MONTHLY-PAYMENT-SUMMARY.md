## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Collection Setup
First, you need to set up the `financePW` collection in your Firebase Firestore:

#### Option A: Manual Setup (Firebase Console)
1. Go to your Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Create a new collection called `financePW`
4. Create a document with ID `access`
5. Add the following fields:
   ```
   password: "your_secure_password"
   createdAt: "2025-01-05T00:00:00.000Z"
   description: "Finance dashboard access password"
   lastUpdated: "2025-01-05T00:00:00.000Z"
   ```

#### Option B: Script Setup (Recommended)
1. Update the Firebase config in `scripts/setup-finance-password.js`
2. Change the default password in the script
3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node setup-finance-password.js
   ```

### 2. Access the Dashboard
1. Navigate to the POS page in your application
2. Click the "Payment Summary" button in the top header
3. Enter the finance password when prompted
4. Explore the dashboard features

## Security Considerations

### Password Management
- **Change Default Password**: Always change the default password after setup
- **Strong Password**: Use a complex password with numbers, letters, and symbols
- **Regular Updates**: Consider updating the password periodically
- **Access Control**: Only share the password with authorized personnel

### Data Protection
- All financial data queries are server-side protected
- Authentication is required for each session
- No sensitive data is cached in browser storage

## Usage Guide

2. **Key Metrics**: Review the four main metric cards at the top
3. **Payment Methods**: Check the distribution between Cash and QR Payment payments
4. **Class Types**: Analyze which class types generate the most revenue

### Understanding Growth Metrics

2. A CSV file will be downloaded with:
   - Summary metrics
   - Payment method breakdown
   - Class type analysis
   - Growth comparisons

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Finance configuration not found"
