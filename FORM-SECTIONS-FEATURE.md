# Form Builder Section Feature üìã

## Overview
The form builder now supports **section-based organization** similar to Google Forms! This allows you to organize questions into logical groups with titles and descriptions, making forms more structured and easier to navigate.

## Key Features

### 1. **Two Modes**
- **Simple Mode**: Traditional single-level question list (backward compatible)
- **Section Mode**: Organize questions into multiple sections with titles and descriptions

### 2. **Easy Toggle**
Switch between modes with a single click:
- **Simple ‚Üí Section**: Automatically wraps existing questions into a default section
- **Section ‚Üí Simple**: Flattens all sections into a single question list

### 3. **Section Management**
- ‚úÖ Add multiple sections
- ‚úÖ Edit section titles and descriptions
- ‚úÖ Drag & drop to reorder sections
- ‚úÖ Duplicate sections (including all questions)
- ‚úÖ Delete sections
- ‚úÖ Collapse/expand sections for easier editing
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Section-level class type filtering** - Control which students see each section

### 4. **Question Management Within Sections**
- ‚úÖ Add questions to any section
- ‚úÖ Drag & drop questions within a section
- ‚úÖ All existing question types supported
- ‚úÖ File uploads work within sections
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Class type filtering moved to section level** - Questions inherit section visibility

### 5. **Student View**
- Beautiful visual section separators
- Section titles and descriptions displayed prominently
- Questions numbered by section (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Progress tracking across all sections
- Sections automatically hidden if student's class type doesn't match

## How to Use

### Creating a Sectioned Form

1. **Create or Edit a Form**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Forms ‚Üí Create New Form (or edit existing)

2. **Enable Section Mode**
   - Click the "Section Mode" button near the top
   - Your existing questions (if any) will be wrapped into a default section

3. **Add Sections**
   - Click "Add Section" button
   - Enter a descriptive title (required)
   - Add an optional description for context
   - **NEW:** Set target class types for the section (optional)
     - Click "Visible to all class types" button
     - Select which class types should see this section
     - Students not in selected class types won't see the section at all

4. **Add Questions to Sections**
   - Each section has its own "Add Question" button
   - Create questions just like before
   - All question types are supported
   - **Note:** Questions inherit section visibility - no need to set class types per question

5. **Organize**
   - Drag sections to reorder them
   - Drag questions within sections to reorder
   - Collapse sections to focus on specific parts
   - Duplicate sections to reuse similar question groups

6. **Save**
   - Click "Save Form" as usual
   - Sections are automatically saved

### Converting Between Modes

#### Simple ‚Üí Section Mode
- Click "Section Mode" button
- Existing questions are placed in a "Main Section"
- You can now add more sections

#### Section ‚Üí Simple Mode  
- Click "Simple Mode" button
- All questions from all sections are flattened into one list
- Section titles and descriptions are removed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This action cannot be easily undone

## Data Structure

### FormSection Interface (Updated)
```typescript
interface FormSection {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  questions: Question[];
  targetClassTypes?: string[]; // NEW: Section-level class filtering
}
```

### Question Interface (Updated)
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  type: QuestionType;
  required: boolean;
  options?: QuestionOption[];
  // ... other fields ...
  // REMOVED: targetClassTypes - now at section level only
}
```

### Form Interface (Updated)
```typescript
interface Form {
  // ... existing fields ...
  questions: Question[];      // Legacy: For backward compatibility
  sections?: FormSection[];   // New: Organized sections
}
```

## Important Changes (v2.0)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
1. **Class Type Filtering Moved to Section Level**
   - Previously: Each question could have its own `targetClassTypes`
   - Now: Only sections have `targetClassTypes`
   - All questions within a section inherit the section's visibility rules
   - This provides better organization and easier management

### Migration Notes
- Old forms with question-level `targetClassTypes` will continue to work in Simple Mode
- When converting to Section Mode, you'll need to set class types at the section level
- This change simplifies form management and makes visibility rules clearer

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Old forms without sections continue to work**
- Forms with only `questions` array display normally
- No data migration required
- Existing forms can be edited in either mode

‚úÖ **Student forms handle both structures**
- Automatically detects if form uses sections
- Renders appropriate UI for each mode
- All features work in both modes

## Visual Design

### Section Headers (Student View)
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds (indigo to purple)
- Left border accent
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Optional descriptions for context

### Question Numbering
- **Section Mode**: Questions numbered by section (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- **Simple Mode**: Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ Green: Completed questions
- üî¥ Red: Required questions with errors
- üîµ Blue: In-progress questions

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/app/_interfaces/forms.ts` - Added FormSection interface
2. `/app/dashboard/forms/_components/SectionEditor.tsx` - New section editor component
3. `/app/dashboard/forms/[formId]/page.tsx` - Form builder with section support
4. `/app/student/forms/[formId]/page.tsx` - Student view with section rendering

### Key Functions

- `updateSection()` - Update section data
- `deleteSection()` - Remove section
- `duplicateSection()` - Copy section with all questions
- `convertToSections()` - Convert simple list to sections
- `convertToQuestions()` - Flatten sections to simple list

#### Student View

- `getVisibleQuestions()` - Filter by student's class type
- `getVisibleSections()` - Get sections with filtered questions

## Best Practices

### When to Use Sections
‚úÖ Forms with multiple logical parts (e.g., Personal Info, Academic Details, Preferences)
‚úÖ Long forms that benefit from organization
‚úÖ Forms where context changes between question groups
‚úÖ Event registrations with different information types

### When to Use Simple Mode
‚úÖ Short forms (< 10 questions)
‚úÖ Single-topic surveys
‚úÖ Quick feedback forms
‚úÖ Forms where all questions are related

## Examples

### Example 1: Event Registration
```
Section 1: Personal Information
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Phone Number

Section 2: Event Preferences  
  - Session Selection
  - Meal Preference
  - T-Shirt Size

Section 3: Additional Information
  - Special Requirements
  - How did you hear about us?
```

### Example 2: Course Feedback
```
Section 1: Course Content
  - Rate the course material
  - Rate the difficulty level
  - Most useful topics

Section 2: Instructor Evaluation
  - Rate the instructor
  - Teaching effectiveness
  - Availability for help

Section 3: Suggestions
  - What can be improved?
  - Would you recommend this course?
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see section mode button
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the form editor (Dashboard ‚Üí Forms ‚Üí Edit Form)

### Issue: Questions disappeared after converting
**Solution**: Check if you're in the right mode. Toggle back to see questions.

### Issue: Section titles not showing to students
**Solution**: Make sure the section has both a title AND at least one visible question

### Issue: Drag and drop not working
**Solution**: Ensure you're grabbing the drag handle (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ icon) at the top of each section/question

üîÆ Potential future features:
- Conditional sections (show/hide based on answers)
- Section-level class type filtering
- Section templates
- Import/export sections between forms
