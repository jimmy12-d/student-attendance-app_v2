## Troubleshooting Workflow

### When You See: ❌ Failed

**Step 1**: Hover over the red "Failed" badge
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Error Details:                              │
│                                             │
│ Chat 123456789: Forbidden: bot was         │
│ blocked by the user                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 2**: Identify the problem
- "blocked by user" = Parent blocked the bot
- "Chat not found" = Session expired
- "bot token missing" = Configuration issue

**Step 3**: Take action
- Contact parent → Ask them to unblock bot → Share registration link
- OR check system configuration if it's a technical issue

### When You See: ⚡ Partial (1/2)

**Step 1**: Hover to see details
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Partial Failure:                            │
│                                             │
│ Chat 987654321: Forbidden: bot was         │
│ blocked by the user                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 2**: Note which parent failed
- One parent received notification (success)
- One parent didn't (shown in error)

**Step 3**: Contact the specific parent who didn't receive notification

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Everything Working
```
✓ 1    ← Parent received notification
✓ 1    ← Parent received notification  
✓ 2    ← Both parents received notification (student has 2 registered parents)
```
**Great!** The system is working perfectly.

---

### Example 2: Mixed Results
```
✓ 1         ← Success
ℹ No Parent  ← Informational (no parent registered)
✗ Failed     ← Needs attention
⚡ 1/2       ← Partially successful (2 parents, only 1 received)
```
**Action Needed**: 
- Check the "Failed" record - hover for details
- Check the "1/2" record - one parent needs help

---

### Example 3: System Issue
```
✗ Failed    ← All failed
✗ Failed    ← All failed
✗ Failed    ← All failed
```
**System-Wide Problem!**

## Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Check notification status daily
- Hover over failed badges to see details
- Keep parents informed about bot status
- Share registration links proactively

❌ **DON'T**:
- Ignore red badges (they won't fix themselves)
- Assume parents received notifications without checking
- Wait for parents to complain before investigating
- Delete attendance records with failed notifications (they're still valid)

---

**Remember**: The notification status is separate from attendance marking. Even if notification fails, the attendance record is still valid and saved correctly! 🎯
